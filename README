Currently Rhythmbox has no way of exporting radio stations.  A method of exporting would be useful for cloning to another computer or when installing a new operating system.  RdoChan extracts radio channels from a Rhythmbox data base file, which contains the radio channels among a list of other things, and merges them with the Rhythmbox data base file in the new system.  The old radio stations records will be merged into the new data base at the end of the new data base radio records and written to a new file.  The two input files will be left intact.  This program was written, more or less, as a way of practicing Ruby, and trying out Git.

To run, place: the program, the old data base and the new data base in the same directory.  You must have the Ruby interpreter in order for the program to work.  The program will prompt you for the name of the two data base files as well as the name of the composite data base which is to be created.  After completion move the created data base to the Rhythmbox folder.  You might want to save the original data base under a new name for safe keeping before rename the composite data base  as“rhythmboxdb.xml”, which is the file Rhythmbox uses to create the list of radio stations.
